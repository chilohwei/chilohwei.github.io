I am focusing on two research areas, one is blockchain and the other is artificial intelligence. To be honest, the emergence of ChatGPT is much faster than expected. Maybe one day in the future, this year is really a very special year.

### Some of my own experiences

Recently, I have been using ChatGPT's new model, and I feel more and more that this will be an epoch-making product. It allows individuals to no longer rely on the shackles of professional knowledge, and creativity can be further released.

Take myself as an example. I have been learning Python crawlers recently, and I want to crawl all the articles in my blog and finally output a table. In the past, I had to think about how to implement it and test it more myself. Now, I only need to tell GPT my needs in natural language, and it will return a code with no problems in the logical structure. All I need to do is change the parameters in it to better meet my actual needs.

Here is the Python crawler code generated by GPT 4 for me. I only made a small adjustment to the find() method and changed the class attribute. The efficiency is amazing.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

# Define the target URL
base_url = 'http://blog.chiloh.com'
page_url = '/page/'

# Initiate a request and get the total number of pages
response = requests.get(base_url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
last_page = int(soup.find('ol', class_='page-navigator').find_all('a')[-2].text.strip())

# Create an empty list to store the title, link, and release time of each article
data = []

# Traverse all paginated pages
for i in range(1, last_page + 1):
url = base_url + page_url + str(i)
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Find the title, link and release time of all articles

articles = soup.find_all('article', class_='post')

# Traverse all articles, extract the title, link and release time, and add them to the data list

for article in articles:

title = article.find('h2', class_='post-title').text.strip()

link = article.find('a', href=True)['href']

date = article.find('date', class_='post-meta').text.strip()

data.append([title, link, date])

# Convert the data list to pandas DataFrame format

df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['title', 'link', 'release time'])

# Save the DataFrame as a table file named typecho

df.to_csv('typecho.csv', index=False)
```

## Some of my own feelings

In the company daily report, I wrote the following sharing of my feelings. In fact, there are some product-related ideas, which were deleted because they are more sensitive. The general meaning is ok. These are some of my own experiences and thoughts in the past six months.

> AI is coming faster than expected. Looking back, many of the products that have emerged before are more like ducks before plumbing. AI is like a child of human wisdom, infinitely close to what we call the ontology, but it is not the ontology. It can be Everything.
>
> My understanding of it is consistent with the exploration I want to achieve in the product after experiencing many products before, combined with my own thinking:
>
> **The barrier to information transmission is reduced**
>
> The human conversational prompt interaction method greatly reduces the difficulty of input and output. Individuals are no longer restricted by the shackles of professional knowledge, and creativity can be further released. Super individuals in a narrow sense will definitely emerge more and more, and the space for expression is a visible growth range.
>
> **Information flows faster**
>
> Multimodal models make information form less important, just as it was imagined a long time ago: information can be solid, liquid, or even gaseous. Now information can be text, pictures, audio, or video.
>
> This means that **maybe there will be a new thing called Flow, which will flow between different applications and different roles. In one application, it is text, and in another application, it may be video, but they essentially want to transmit the same sequence of information. **
>
> Cross-modal information will be a natural Flow when it circulates. It can flow into any shape and become what you want.
>
> **Information quality loss and restoration**
>
> The transformation of information form is bound to have some loss in different time and space. When changing from video to text, the image will be lost, just like when we have a meeting, we need to see the camera, and this part is the lost information. **Thinking in reverse, what we are doing is to restore the essence of the information as much as possible. **
>
> Just like an online meeting, the offline part where everyone can see each other is lost, so many conference software will do cameras, enhance eye contact, and do noise reduction processing, which are essentially restoring the full picture of information in time and space.
>
> In different time and space, the loss of different information is different, which means a variety of information supplies. It is necessary to customize how to provide it to the next time and space scene in a free way. Different scenes and roles have different needs for information. In the process of restoring the full picture of information, it is more like choosing more important parts from these supplies and trying to restore them in this "field".
>
> Considering the circulation of information in different time and space as a kind of "death", AGI's generation ability is doing "creation and rebirth". Some information died in the previous time and space, but some will be reborn in the next time and space
