Today's training course is about the flow of inspiration. The original intention is to remove the cover of thinking, so that the higher level of consciousness behind thinking can be directly connected with behavior, so that another "I" can emerge naturally. Here I share my own feelings:

- **Accumulation**

> There is a sentence in "Bow and Zen": "People who focus on watching bamboo for ten years will become bamboo themselves. Then, forget everything; then, paint!"

In my understanding, watching bamboo for ten years is to see the "shape" of bamboo. After watching for a long time, or accumulating enough "shapes", you will begin to touch the "spirit" of bamboo. The "God" here can be regarded as a small part of conscious awareness. When you enter the realm of No Mind, this small part of "God" is like absorbing energy and growing into an external aggregate of conscious awareness, which is what Professor Shanyou said "it".

Form and God, from quantitative change to qualitative change, are about the method of breaking the veil of thinking. We are often obscured by the "form" of the appearance of things, so we cannot see the "God" of the essence of things. The first step to break the veil of thinking is: accumulation.

- **Training**

To break the veil of thinking, accumulation is the first step, but sufficient accumulation only opens a small gap in the channel of conscious awareness, which can flow occasionally. If you want inspiration to flow every moment, you need to perceive other parts outside the conscious gap through continuous training, and further expand this flowing channel.

Taking product work as an example, a large amount of experience of product interaction, design and other things is a process of accumulation; through this accumulation, we will gradually perceive the logical pattern behind the interaction and design, store it in our minds, and then call it at any time as needed in daily work. This process is the training process of breaking the veil of thinking.

If one day, you see what is behind the logical model, have your own "God", and break away from the model of others, maybe you can make a product with your own soul at this time.

- **No Thought**

The key to the flow of inspiration is no thought, which is the last step to break the veil of thinking. When you first look at the understanding of no thought, it seems to be saying that you should focus on the present and not be distracted by gains and losses. To understand it with a similar word, it is somewhat similar to "harmony between man and nature". The state of no thought is more like a superego state of unity of soul and flesh. It is a collection of the laws of "heaven", which is manifested through the carrier of "man".

All things have spirits, and "spirit" and "heaven", "Tao", "Zen", "essence", and "law" seem to be talking about the same thing. Consider this "spirit" as an ultimate collection of conscious consciousness. All the culture, history, or everything left in the dimensions of time and space are just carriers of consciousness.

**We are all in the river of inspiration, glimpsing a corner but not the whole picture.**
