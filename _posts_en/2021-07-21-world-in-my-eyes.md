The company's product department often asks open-ended questions during training sessions. This week's theme is "U-shaped Thinking," and there are two questions that I find particularly interesting. I'd like to share my understanding of the world through these questions.

#### Question 1

> When it comes to implementing a principle, "think it through, allocate resources, and deploy," what is the relationship between these three aspects? Share your understanding.

Before answering this question, I'd like to share my underlying logic: objects + relationships, which is also my worldview. In my cognition, **the world is a complex network system composed of objects and relationships**. For example, I am an object, and a duck can also be considered an object. If we delve deeper, there must be some kind of relational path between the objects of "me" and "duck."

- Moving up from an object leads to a "class"; the object "me" belongs to the class "human," while the object "duck" belongs to the class "animal."
- Moving down from an object leads to "values"; for instance, the object "me" has many attribute values: gender, age, preferences, and so on.

This bears a striking resemblance to the concepts of objects, classes, and values in object-oriented programming. In object-oriented programming, there are relationships between classes, such as inheritance, implementation, association, dependency, aggregation, and composition, with varying degrees of coupling. Within the same class, calling the same method can operate on objects or assign values.

Based on the underlying cognitive logic above, structurally thinking about this question reveals a model similar to a "supply-demand chain":

The demand side is an object, the supply side is an object, and the two objects are connected by a relationship; they are mutually coupled through a two-way relational structure.

- Think it through: Identify what resources are needed (the demand for achieving the goal).
- Allocate resources: Provide the necessary resources (the supply for achieving the goal).
- Deploy: How to circulate the resources (the path between demand and supply).

From a different perspective, cognitively thinking about this question reveals a model similar to the "Golden Circle Rule":

Why is an object, how is an object, and what is also an object; the three are mutually coupled through a hierarchical relationship structure within a broader class.

- Think it through: Why it needs to be done (clear project strategy and alignment).
- Allocate resources: How to implement it (availability of human and material resources).
- Deploy: What to do to implement it (alignment of resources and strategy).

From yet another angle, perhaps a completely different answer could be obtained. "**There is no fixed law, but then one knows that non-law is also law.**"

#### Question 2

> Have you ever crossed the wall of the unknown? Do you have any personal experiences in this regard?

The wall of the unknown, as I understand it, is equivalent to one's cognitive boundary. From this perspective, I can barely claim to have crossed the wall of the unknown.

The wall of the unknown, for me, is my worldview, and it is also the boundary of my cognition, which is constantly growing...

My deepest experiences in this area are:

- In the past, when thinking about problems, I would often start from scattered points and then try to find possible relationships between those points.
- Now, when thinking about problems, I often have structural or cognitive thoughts that draw parallels from other domains.
    
    - For example, from a decentralized structure, I associate it with information equality, and then abstract it further to the transfer of rights to individuals.
    - For example, from the cyclical transformation of the five elements, I associate it with energy circulation and transformation, leading to [energy, frequency, and channels](https://blog.chiloh.com/2021-05-18/energy-world.html).
    - For example, from disruptive innovation, I associate it with the limit formula, where C is the boundary of the unknown variable x, and L is the true higher-dimensional world.
