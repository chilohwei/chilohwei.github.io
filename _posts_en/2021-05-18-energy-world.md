The last class of the company's God of War Camp is over. Although it is said that I joined halfway, I really learned a lot. In last night's class, Professor Shanyou talked about: Call of Duty, mentioning the two major missions of life, the inner mission is to become a monistic consciousness, and the outer mission is to create beautiful works. This reminds me of many things:

**The material world is a projection of the energy world**

> Everything in the universe is energy

This is the sentence that attracted me the most in yesterday's class, and it is also a very scary point of view. When I saw this point of view, I immediately thought of a saying: The material world is a projection of the energy world

The energy world here seems to be similar to the world of ideas we are learning. If the energy world, or the world of ideas, is real, then is the material world just an illusion that does not exist, a projection of the world of ideas, or a virtual construction?

To put it another way, the material world we experience is not a simulation and construction based on the information we receive as observers. Because different subjects have different energy projections of receiving information, there are all binary opposites such as rich and poor, good and evil, beauty and ugliness.

Perhaps the universe lives in the consciousness of each of you or me. You or I are the creators of the universe we experience, and we are all the monistic consciousness of the origin.

Our mission from the moment we are born is to solve the mystery in the womb, find our true self, become a monistic consciousness, and then absorb energy, and then create a cycle, which can be called the "I" in the next life.

**Energy, frequency and channel**

If everything is energy, can we understand it this way: in the material world, the tangible and colored things are actually the product of us establishing a channel after we are in the same frequency with energy and then projecting its energy information. And those things that cannot be recognized by us are because we cannot resonate with energy through frequency and generate the channel of energy field, so we cannot receive this part of energy information.

There are three key words in this view: *energy*, *frequency*, and *channel*s. That is, the world of ideas, or the world of energy, is itself composed of various invisible and colorless energies. Only by resonating with the same frequency and building an energy channel can the energy world be projected into the material world to obtain energy information, that is, the shape and color of matter.

**How ​​does life absorb energy?**

When I thought of the above, I suddenly had the answer to this question in my mind: So how can we in the material world absorb energy from the source of the world of ideas?

The answer is actually very simple, **same frequency, same frequency, same frequency**!

Thinking from the existing knowledge system, to keep energy in the best state, on the one hand, we need to reduce energy consumption, and on the other hand, we need to increase energy intake.

- Reducing energy consumption is actually talking about the same frequency. Meditation is the same frequency as breathing, and Zen is the same frequency as thoughts; in the material world, all moving things that are not in the same frequency as you are actually consuming your energy. For example, arguing with people who disagree with you and interacting with people who don’t like you are all consuming your energy, so you will feel very tired.

- Increasing energy intake is actually talking about the same frequency. The process of breaking the boundary is that you perceive the energy of the current frequency and cannot meet your own needs. So you need to learn to build energy information channels and capture energy of other frequencies when you send out signals. One person’s power is limited, so you need to join an organization and absorb energy from the energy field through the same frequency resonance.

Life is the acquisition and release of energy, which is easier said than done. Perhaps the combination of **energy, frequency, and channel** can explain more existence in the material world.
