summary: Since the last article:[Old Words](http://blog.chiloh.cn/archives/old-words.html) mentioned that when I was in college, I recorded my feelings for a period of time in the "Parallel World" mobile app. Recently, when I was sorting out the cloud disk data, I saw the remaining more than 100 card records. I selected a few more from them, hoping that the text can help you get to know me better.

Since the last article: [Old Words](http://blog.chiloh.cn/2020-08-19/old-words.html) mentioned that when I was in college, I recorded my feelings for a period of time in the "Parallel World" mobile app. Recently, when I was sorting out the cloud disk data, I saw the remaining more than 100 card records.

### Old

Time flies by

It’s already past in a flash

### Restraint

Sometimes I have impulses
Imagine myself in the old days
I act recklessly
But what growing up has taught me
is just restraint
Yes, restraint

Many thoughts often arise
Some die just after birth
Some grow tall in the blink of an eye
And more are
Nurtured into beautiful bubbles
Self-shattered and then disillusioned

People
Always have to convince themselves first
Before they can be cruel enough
But I
Never want to be a cruel person

### Long

A year is almost over
The time I stayed here
I have been longer than all the past
Under the dyed hair color
Stripe of snow is showing again
I am older than you
It is reasonable to be older than you
In this way
It is not so difficult to accept

I haven’t written anything for a long time
In fact, I have been very busy recently
The days are monotonous and pale
When I lie on the bed and listen to music
Your appearance is still there
Your voice is still there
Just a certain me
I have walked a few years longer than you
Just like usual

### Chapter 80

In the evening
I was in low spirits
Sitting quietly for a long time
Without saying a word
My mind was full of thoughts about me
The meaning of life

Like many times before
I gave up after thinking about it
So
I went downstairs to buy a lot of food
Eat all the dinner I didn’t eat a few nights ago
I thought I would go to bed early after eating
Finally, I played a few games with my roommates in laughter

Life is so bland
No love-hate entanglement
No worries
Let the mood flow
I just hope that day
I will still be me

### Morning and dusk

When I woke up
The sky outside was still dark
I tried for a long time
I could no longer close my glasses
As usual
I scrolled through the circle of friends
Everyone is doing well
We are all moving so fast together

My mind is in chaos
I am full of random thoughts again
I suddenly feel so tired
I really want to let go
No empty social life
No busy pressure
It's just me
I have tried but still can't do it
Let's stop here
The rest of the words are for myself
That's it
