In 2023, I tried many things, but the most beneficial was "Zen meditation." Before that, I had been practicing sitting meditation for over half a year. But in reality, this year marked the true beginning of my Zen practice, with the guidance of fellow practitioners and the imprint of my heart's traces.

This year, I tried many things:

1. I met some new friends.
2. I had a brief romance after ten years.
3. I attended two live concerts of my favorite singers.
4. I tried internal and external speeches and live broadcasts.
5. I picked up the pen again and wrote over 100 memos.

## Insights from Zen Meditation

Among the above, some were things I wouldn't have done before, like making new friends. For me, it was truly an energy-consuming task.

While others were things I wanted to do but hadn't gotten around to, like dating, attending concerts, and picking up writing again. For me, they felt more like things I had lost and needed to muster the courage to reclaim.

But in the end, I tried them all, regardless of the good or bad results, which is not important. What I want to express is that all of this is inseparable from what "Zen meditation" has brought me:

**1. Equanimity:**

After impermanence comes equanimity. Calmly accepting all possibilities in life – birth, aging, sickness, and death, causes and conditions coming together. It feels like: someone knocks on your door, and all you need to do is open it and be your true self.

As for what story unfolds after the door is opened, that's the "future mind" grasping. Any arising thought or movement plants a seed in the alaya consciousness, which will blossom at some point in the cycle of rebirth.

All we need to do is be present in the moment. "Eat when it's time to eat, chop wood when it's time to chop wood," but do good deeds without asking about the future. Gradually, you'll find that you can smell the fragrance of flowers while walking, taste the flavor of the sky, and notice things that have always been there but you've never seen before.

This is my most genuine, firsthand experience, and its beauty is indescribable.

**2. The Mind of Renunciation**

I've always felt that I wasn't free enough, as if bound by some illusory thing. So for a long period, I had many biases and resistance within, trying to gain more "freedom."

Later, I came to understand Sartre's philosophy, which gave me another perspective and resonated with my own understanding of myself and the world. Just as I shared in the daily report:

> When interacting with others, everyone wants to turn the other into an object to maintain their own subjectivity and freedom. Absolute ideal freedom and subjectivity may not exist. Being able to accept the coexistence of subject and object within the self is "Tathata," and the absence of subject and object may be the state of emptiness.

The mind of renunciation is to understand the non-self of the individual, transcend self-centeredness, and see the vast existence beyond the individual. "I" can be extremely large or extremely small. To put it more colloquially, it's a bit like what people often refer to as the "size of the ego."

Letting go is renunciation. If there are things in your heart that you're obsessing over, try letting go of that "self-grasping" and you may see a more expansive world.

## Gains from Zen Meditation
**Facing impermanence with equanimity and the mind of renunciation, doing what I should in each present moment – this is my greatest gain from "Zen meditation."**

You love someone not to gain anything from them, but simply because your love is flowing in this moment......

You are like a "vessel," and this "love" is the essence, flowing through you. Whether the other person accepts or rejects it is a cause and condition. Know that "impermanence" is the constant state of life.

"Subhuti, the past mind cannot be grasped, the present mind cannot be grasped, the future mind cannot be grasped." To gain it, first let go of the "self," and let the "essence" manifest naturally.

## Outlook for the Coming Year

2024 will be a relatively important year. As for my aspirations for myself, they are very simple:

- **Be True to Myself:** Make every effort to be authentic, to express myself genuinely, and to experience the world genuinely.
- **Be Present in the Moment:** Eat when it's time to eat, do what needs to be done, but do good deeds without asking about the future.

In my free time, I'll go and see the world; when I'm busy, I'll savor life. Two people sharing three meals is enough for a lifetime.
